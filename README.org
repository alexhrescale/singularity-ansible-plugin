* (experimental) Singularity connector for ansible

this is based on the Ansible
[[https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/lib/ansible/plugins/connection/local.py][local connection]] plugin

* Usage

** ansible setup

Find where the ansible plugins directory is. It is probably in

=$PYTHONPATH/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ansible/plugins/connection/=

you can symlink =singularity.py= into that directory

** container

create a container at =/path/to/container.simg=
by running =sudo singularity image.create /path/to/container.simg/ docker://ubuntu:latest=

** playbook and hosts

Prepare this inventory file at =hosts=

#+BEGIN_SRC conf
[all]
/path/to/container.simg ansible_connection=singularity
#+END_SRC

And this playbook at =playbook.yml=

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :eval never
- name: test playbook
  hosts: all
  connection: singularity
  tasks:
  - name: test command
    shell: whoami

  - name: Update APT package cache
    apt: update_cache=yes

  - name: install cool stuff
    apt: name={{ item }} state=present
    with_items:
      - tmux
      - vim
#+END_SRC

** running

=sudo ansible-playbook -i hosts, playbook.yml=
